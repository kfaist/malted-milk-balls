🎯 QUICK OBS SETUP - DO THIS NOW!
========================================

IN OBS (you have it open already):

1. CREATE SCENE
   - Click "+" under Scenes (bottom left)
   - Name: "Claymation-Live"
   - Click OK

2. ADD BROWSER SOURCE
   - Click "+" under Sources (bottom middle)
   - Choose "Browser"
   - Name: "User-Camera-Browser"
   - Click OK

3. CONFIGURE BROWSER SOURCE
   Copy these settings EXACTLY:

   URL: https://malted-milk-balls.up.railway.app/auto-camera.html
   (Check Railway dashboard for your exact URL!)

   Width: 1280
   Height: 720
   FPS: 30

   ✅ CHECK THESE BOXES:
   ✅ Refresh browser when scene becomes active
   ✅ Shutdown source when not visible

   Click OK!

4. POSITION THE SOURCE
   - Drag/resize the browser source to fit your canvas
   - Should show split-screen: left=user camera, right=processed

5. TEST IT
   - Visit your Railway URL in a regular browser
   - Allow camera access
   - You should see the camera feed in BOTH places:
     * In your browser
     * In OBS Browser Source

========================================

🔥 NEXT: Set up NDI Output
- Add Filter to Browser Source → NDI Output
- Name it "TouchDesigner"
- Now TD can receive via NDI In TOP!

========================================

✅ DONE? Check that:
- Browser source shows in OBS
- User camera appears on left side
- Right side says "Waiting for TouchDesigner..."
- NDI is working (check TD receives feed)
